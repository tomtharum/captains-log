  Now why is building your own PC is better than buying a prebuilt system? So building your own pc is 
  better than just buying a prebuild system from like Alienware, Asus ROG ? Building your own system may
  easier to fix and customize and better overall quality and sometimes certain prebuilt system often cheap
  out on mostly unoticeable things like wifi card, ssd, ... But building your own PC may need a lot of 
  researching but I am hear to help you with that by this post:

 The Best Gaming PC

 -CPU: Intel Core i5-12600KF
 -CPU Cooler: Be Quiet! Shadow Rock Slim 2
 -Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming Z690-Plus WiFi D4 LGA1700(Intel 12th Gen) ATX gaming motherboard
 -Ram: G.SKILL F4-3600C16D-16GTZR 16 GB
 -Storage: Samsung (MZ-V8V250B/AM) 980 SSD 250GB,Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive
 -GPU: EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC GAMING, 08G-P5-3553-KR
 -Case: MSI MAG Series FORGE 100R
 -PSU: EVGA 700 GD, 80+ GOLD 700W
  
  This PC is well capable of running graphics intensive games like Cyberpunk 2077 at Ultra settings smoothly or 
 Forza Horizon 5 at Medium settings smoothly. This PC is gonna be ultra smooth at almost everything you throw at.
 The processor in this rig is really good for the price and is gonna handle task like browsing...
  
  The Best Budget Gaming PC
 
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600
  -CPU Cooler: Vetroo V5 CPU Air Cooler w/ 5 Heat Pipes 120mm PWM Processor 150W TDP Cooler
  -Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming B450M-PRO S AMD AM4
  -Ram: TEAMGROUP T-Force Vulcan Z DDR4 16GB Kit (2x8GB) 3200MHz
  -Storage: TEAMGROUP MP33 1TB SLC Cache 3D NAND TLC NVMe 1.3 PCIe Gen3x4 M.2 2280 Internal Solid State Drive SSD
  -GPU: EVGA GeForce RTX 3050 XC GAMING, 08G-P5-3553-KR
  -PSU: Corsair CV Series, CV550, 550 Watt, 80+ Bronze Certified
  -Case: Thermaltake V200 Tempered Glass RGB Edition 12V MB Sync Capable ATX Mid-Tower Chassis
  
  This PC is the budget pick for us but it can play most games at medium settings at around 60-100 frames.
 This is gonna be a decent PC for general usage, though you may need to flash BIOS update to the motherboard 
 The stock cooler included in the box is fairly decent and can handle a little light overclocking but not 
 recommended. You can overclock it to get some really good performance and the cooler I included here is gonna 
 be able to handle it well.
 
  The Best No-GPU PC
  
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700G
  -CPU Cooler: beQuiet! BK024 Dark Rock Slim CPU Cooler
  -Motherboard: MSI B550-A PRO ProSeries Motherboard AMD AM4, DDR4
  -Ram: Patriot Viper 4 Blackout Series DDR4 16GB (2 x 8GB) 4400MHz Kit
  -Storage: Samsung (MZ-V8V250B/AM) 980 SSD 250GB,Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive
  -PSU: Thermaltake SMART 600W ATX 12V V2.3/EPS 12V 80 Plus Certified Active PFC Power Supply
  -Case: Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 Mesh White Airflow ATX Mid-Tower
  
   Due to the current gpu crisis, IGPU are making more sense and some of the best IGPU come from AMD and this build
  is a great alternative to some graphics card. This build is gonna game but don't expect it to game at the highest 
  settings or play demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Horizon 5 and other demanding games.
  
  The Best Family PC Build
  
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600
  -CPU Cooler: Stock Cooler
  -Motherboard: ASUS Prime B450M-A II AMD AM4 Micro-ATX

  -GPU: ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 OC Edition Graphics Card
  -PSU: Corsair CV450

   This PC is great for family use, you can do many task on this computer smoothly like watching movies, researching
  and even play some games that doesn't use much resources.
  
  The Best Gaming Compact PC Build

  -PSU: EVGA 700 GD, 80+ GOLD 700W
  -Case: Cooler Master NR200 White SFF Small Form Factor Mini-ITX Case
  
   This gaming PC build is a great build if you don't really have space for a mid-tower or full-tower, you may consider this
  build. This would perform great in games.
  
  My Preference
  
  -CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X
  -CPU Cooler: NZXT Kraken Z73
  -Motherboard:  ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero AMD AM4 X570S
  -Ram: G.Skill Trident Z NEO Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) 288-Pin SDRAM DDR4 4000
  -Storage: Samsung 980 PRO SSD 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe Gen 4,Seagate Barracuda Computer 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Interanl Hard Drive
  -GPU: ASUS ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 OC Edition Gaming Graphics Card
  -PSU: be quiet! Straight Power 11 Platinum 850W, BN643, Fully Modular, Power Supply
  -Case: NZXT H510 Elite
  
   I prefer this build because for I don't game much and if I ever game I would never play demanding games so I could use the
  intregrated graphics but I think gtx 1660 super is overkill for me because I usually do stuff like researching, online class
  and watching videos. I just put some overkill parts to future-proofing it so I don't need to upgrade it soon because most 
  computers get obsolete in just a few years.
